# Overview

This is a very basic example of a movie suggestion program written in Java. It consists of the main class, App.java, and five different movie classes that each contain an array of movies and a method that displays one randomly.

I wrote this software to challenge myself. I know that Java is a very commonly used language, so I have been eager to learn it. I hope to add more to this program in the future as I become more familiar with the language.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

This program was written in VS Code and uploaded to a public repository in GitHub. Youtube videos were essential to my learning and writing of this software.

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

Java is one of the most popular languages. It came about in 1995 when a team was tying to make C++ a little cleaner to use. Today, 95% of companies use it as their primary language (GeeksforGeeks).
